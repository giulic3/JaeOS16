# JaeOS16

JaeOS was developed as an educational operating system and intended to be run using the [MicroARM Emulator](http://mellotanica.github.io/uARM/).


### Testing

The project is divided into 3 phases (p0, p1 and p2), each one must be tested separately.

How to execute and test p0test.c :

	- comment the following line of the file clist.h : 
		typedef unsigned int size_t;

	- generate executable file using:
		$ gcc ./p0test.c
	
	- launch and test with:
		$ ./a.out


How to execute and test p1test.c :
	
	- comment out the line above of the file clist.h
	
	- generate the executable file using the phase1_makefile provided: 
		$ make -f phase1_makefile

	- launch the MicroARM Emulator using: 
		$ uarm

	- click on "Machine Configs"

	- in section "Boot", "Core file", click on Browse... and select the jaeos16.core.uarm file generated by make.

	- in section "Debugging Support", "Symbol Table", click on Browse... and select the jaeos16.stab.uarm file generated by make. 

	- click "Power on" to boot up the emulator
	
	- open terminal 0 on "Terminals".

	- click "Play" to boot the OS.

How to execute and test p2test.c :

	- clean old executable file
		$ make cleanall

	- generate the executable file using the makefile provided: 
		$ make

	- launch the MicroARM Emulator using: 
		$ uarm

	- click on "Machine Configs"

	- in section "Boot", "Core file", click on Browse... and select the jaeos16.core.uarm file generated by make.

	- in section "Debugging Support", "Symbol Table", click on Browse... and select the jaeos16.stab.uarm file generated by make. 

	- click "Power on" to boot up the emulator
	
	- open terminal 0 on "Terminals".
